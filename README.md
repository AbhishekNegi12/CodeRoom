### Needs Addressed by Code Room:
1. **Seamless Collaboration**: Developers, students, and instructors need tools that allow collaborative coding, whether for pair programming, group projects, or coding workshops. Code Room meets this need by enabling multiple users to work on the same codebase in real time.
2. **Remote Work and Learning**: As remote work and online education grow, so does the need for interactive coding environments. Code Room addresses this by providing a virtual workspace where users can code together as if they were side-by-side.
3. **Instant Feedback**: Collaborative coding environments often require immediate feedback on changes. Code Room’s real-time functionality allows participants to see updates instantly, enabling fast-paced development and reducing communication delays.
4. **Version Consistency**: Code Room ensures everyone is always on the same version of the code, minimizing conflicts and errors that can arise from out-of-sync codebases.

### Advantages to Users:
1. **Real-Time Interaction**: Users experience minimal lag in receiving updates, creating a natural, productive coding environment. This makes the app ideal for live code reviews, coding interviews, and troubleshooting sessions.
2. **Enhanced Productivity**: By reducing the need for frequent check-ins and file exchanges, Code Room improves team productivity, allowing users to focus on coding rather than managing updates.
3. **Ease of Use**: With WebSockets powering instant updates, users don’t need to manually refresh or pull code changes. They can focus entirely on coding, which simplifies collaboration.
4. **Educational Support**: For students and educators, the app provides an interactive platform for live coding sessions, enhancing learning by allowing instructors to guide students through coding exercises step-by-step.
5. **Resource Efficiency**: Compared to traditional polling methods, Code Room uses resources efficiently, leading to a smoother user experience without excessive server or network load.
